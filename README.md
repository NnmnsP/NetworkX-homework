- Create a Python file that imports NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries
- Create a weighted undirected graph and draw it with vertex and edge labels, and save it as a PNG or JPG file
- Find the shortest path from the first to the last vertex, print the resulting sequence of edges, draw the result with different edge color, and save the drawing to another file
